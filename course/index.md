# Intro to CS

## Welcome!

If you’re reading this, then you somehow got ahold of this crash course on programming. However you got here, welcome! This crash course assumes that you’ve done some level of programming. By leveraging this assumption, we try to give an overview on programming, so you know how to go from problem to programmed solution.

The idea isn’t to fully replace intro CS courses; instead it aims to ensure that you leave this course conversant in programming. You should know what basic data structures are, common syntax and libraries for Java and Python, and get some UI/UX knowledge with Figma. This isn’t a complete overview, and is just a stepping stone to establish and/or reinforce CS fundamentals. From here, you should be set up to self-learn or take more courses on Systems programming (C and lower-level regarding networks, operating systems, etc) or to go on to application programming in Java or a similar language. You can even branch out to do ML implementations with Python, or UX work in HTML-CSS. This course is truly meant to be a stepping stone to bridge the gap that intro CS classes span in college.

## Course Structure

This course will primarily be a “learn by doing” course. There will be 8+ programming assignments to complete, along with readings that relate to the assignments. By doing the assignments, you should gain a solid understanding of the material, using the readings to supplement this.
