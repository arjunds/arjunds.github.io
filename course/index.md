# Intro to CS

## Welcome!

If you’re reading this, then you somehow got ahold of this crash course on programming. However you got here, welcome! This crash course assumes that you’ve done some level of programming. By leveraging this assumption, we try to give an overview on programming, so you know how to go from problem to programmed solution.

This originated when a friend in Bioengineering wanted to know enough programming concepts to be able to handle any software-related tasks and use this as a starting point for a complete change of industry if they wanted to. Therefore, this is very much tailored to people who may have worked with Matlab, or Python, in a data processing/college course context, but never actually had a formal intro to programming fundamentals and structures.

The idea isn’t to fully replace intro CS courses; instead it aims to ensure that you leave this course conversant in programming. You should know what basic data structures are, common syntax and libraries for Java and Python, and get some UI/UX knowledge with Figma. This isn’t a complete overview, and is just a stepping stone to establish and/or reinforce CS fundamentals.

More specifically, you'll learn Object Oriented Programming through Java, basic Data Structures including Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees. You'll also have a basic introduction to Python, Git, Figma, and common CS algorithms at an implementation-level. From here, you can branch out into learning more about Systems programming (Operating Systems, Networks, Computer Architecture), application programming (desktop applications and servers), and/or UI/UX and web development.

## Course Structure

This course will primarily be a “learn by doing” course. There will be 8+ programming assignments to complete, along with readings that relate to the assignments. By doing the assignments, you should gain a solid understanding of the material, using the readings to supplement this.
